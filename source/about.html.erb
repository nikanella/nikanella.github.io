            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Nikoletta Kanellou. I live in Athens, Greece and cinnamon.design is the design side of me.</p>
            <p>I graduated from the NTUA School of Architecture in 2007 and have an MA in Digital Arts, from the Athens School of Fine Arts (2011).</p>
            <p>I worked as an architect for a few years but soon developed an interest in digital media and got involved in various digital productions, focusing mainly in web design.</p>
            <p>My architectural and multimedia work has been awarded and presented in several architecture and art exhibitions. As a team member, I received the "Best project of the years 2009-2013" award from DOMÃ‰S International Review of Architecture.</p>
            <p>I find many similarities between architecture and web design and I enjoy applying architectural synthesis and structure principles in the digital and physical space.</p>
