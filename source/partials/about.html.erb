          <h1>Hi There!</h1>
          <p>Hi, my name is Nikoletta Kanellou. I live in Athens, Greece and cinnamon.design is the design side of me.</p>
          <p>My academic background includes a Diploma in Architecture from the NTUA School of Architecture and an MA in Digital Arts from the Athens School of Fine Arts.</p>
          <p>I started working as an architect but soon developed an interest in digital media and got involved in various digital productions, focusing mainly in web design.</p>
          <p>My architectural and multimedia work has been awarded and presented in several architecture and art exhibitions. As a team member, I received the "Best project of the years 2009-2013" award from DOMÃ‰S International Review of Architecture.</p>
          <p>I find many similarities between architecture and web/application design and I enjoy applying the principles of structure and form/function synthesis in the digital and physical space.</p>
