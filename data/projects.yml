    description: 'Installation with real time generated video (based on 146 video clips source) and 3d animation via Processing
    programming language.<br /><br />“Steps in non-places” presents the narrative of a character’s perpetual wandering within a new space that is composed dynamically through the use of cinematic language and algorithmic logic. The generation of the new space is based on a non-linear composition of cinematic fragments that transcribe a character’s movements within isolated spaces of public buildings. The composition is realized by an algorithm that includes rules that define the possibilities of succession between the fragments and can produce multiple alternative narratives. The execution of the algorithm generates a narration that is reproduced cinematically, while the corresponding spaces and movements are dynamically visualized in a three- dimensional graphic environment. Physical space does not allow the realization of the generated intricate space and movements, but virtual space makes possible their representation as a sculptural form of spatial nebulae penetrated by a continuous three- dimensional linear stroke. The project addresses a dual aspect of rationality. The produced narratives reveal the actions of a programmed man, a man-machine who ceaselessly performs movements in space traversing the built environment, a man programmed not to stop before reaching his target. However, when the target constantly fluctuates and the spaces are structured differently on every occasion, a distortion of reality emerges, where rationality loses ground.'
